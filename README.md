## Table of Contents

## JavaScript 101
I choose to make a complete different and new website where I can demonstrate Progressive Enhancement without interfering with my Express application that can be found in the blocktech repo.

### Concept
The concept of this website is that it teaches the visitor the very basics of JavaScript. 

## Enhancements
The enhancements are made with the idea of accessibility.

### With JS
With JavaScript the user is served with a progressionbar that shows where one is on the page while scrolling.

With JavaScript the user is served with two stylesheets. By pressing one of the buttons the link item in the head gets replaced by a different source file. The native behaviour of the links are cancelled thus the browser does not navigate to 

### Without JS
Without JavaScript the progressionbar is not being shown due css.

Without JavaScript the user navigates to a html section where the other css stylesheets are implemented.
