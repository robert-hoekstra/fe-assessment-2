                <h4>What is JavaScript</h4>
                <p>JavaScript is what is called 
                    a Client-side Scripting Language. 
                    That means that it is a computer programming 
                    language that runs inside an Internet browser 
                    (a browser is also known as a Web client because 
                    it connects to a Web server to download pages).

                <h4>Why do we use JavaScript</h4>
                <p>Let’s take a step back and count the merits of JavaScript:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript is very easy to implement. All you need to do is put your code in the HTML document and tell the browser that it is JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript works on web users’ computers — even when they are offline!</li>
                    <li>JavaScript allows you to create highly responsive interfaces that improve the user experience and provide dynamic functionality, without having to wait for the server to react and show another page.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript can load content into the document if and when the user needs it, without reloading the entire page — this is commonly referred to as Ajax.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript can test for what is possible in your browser and react accordingly — this is called Principles of unobtrusive JavaScript or sometimes defensive scripting.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript can help fix browser problems or patch holes in browser support — for example fixing CSS layout issues in certain browsers.</li>
                </ul>

                </p>
                <h4>How do we use JavaScript</h4>
                <p>
                    You can add JavaScript code in an HTML document by employing the dedicated HTML tag &lt;script&gt; that wraps around JavaScript code.
                </p>
                <p> The &lt;script&gt; tag can be placed in the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML, in the &lt;body&gt; section, or after the &lt;/body&gt; close tag, depending on when you want the JavaScript to load.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Generally, JavaScript code can go inside of the document &lt;head&gt; section in order to keep them contained and out of the main content of your HTML document.
                    However, if your script needs to run at a certain point within a page&rsquo;s layout &mdash; like when using document.write to generate content &mdash; you should put it at the point where it should be called, usually within the &lt;body&gt; section. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-javascript-to-html">Source</a>
